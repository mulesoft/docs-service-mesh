Because APIs constantly change, Anypoint Service Mesh allows you to update the specification of your API within the same major version (only minor and patch bumps allowed). You can update an API using Anypoint Platform or Anypoint Service Mesh:

* <<update-api-cli,Update an API using Anypoint Service Mesh>>
+
If your API resource exists in the cluster, you can update it to trigger changes in Anypoint Platform, such as creating or modifying asset versions and API instances.
* <<update-api-AP, Update an API using Anypoint Platform>>
+
After a new version of an API is published to Anypoint Exchange (Exchange), you can update the API instances associated with it to use this new version of the asset.
+
You can update the asset tags from Exchange and the API instance tags in API Manager.


[[update-api-cli]]
== Update an API Using the Aypoint Service Mesh Command Line Interface

If you configured the API using the Anypoint Service Mesh autocreate feature, you can update the API from the cluster when required. The update reuses the environment details and credentials introduced when provisioning the API. 

To update the API:

. From the Anypoint Service Mesh CLI, run the following command:
+
