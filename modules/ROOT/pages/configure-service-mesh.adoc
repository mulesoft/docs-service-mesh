== Overview

To configure Anypoint Service Mesh, you must first provision the Anypoint Service Mesh adapter, create an API, and then bind the adapter to that API. Each adapter is bound to a specific namespace. Therefore, a namespace can be associated with only one adapter at any given time. 

Every service that you want Anypoint Service Mesh to manage from your Kubernetes cluster must have a corresponding API in Anypoint Platform. After you create the API, you must then bind the service in the cluster to the corresponding API in Anypoint Platform. 

In Kubernetes, services are an abstraction on top of the applications running on a set of pods as a network service. You configure Anypoint Service Mesh using the following three steps:

. Provision Anypoint Service Mesh Adapter.
. Create an API.
. Bind your service.

== Methods for Configuring Anypoint Service Mesh

You can configure Anypoint Service Mesh using the command line interface (CLI) or using the Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) based on your preference:

* xref::configure-using-CLI.adoc[Using CLI]
* xref::configure-using-CRD.adoc[Using CRD]

== Configuring Response Headers for Anypoint Service Mesh

Services protected by Anypoint Service Mesh return extra headers. These headers are added by Envoy and the gRPC adapter. You can remove these headers to avoid returning them to the originating client.

To remove the headers:

. Log in to your Ingress server.
. Search for and remove the following headers added by Envoy:
* `x-envoy-upstream-service-time`
* `x-envoy-decorator-operation`
. Search for and remove the `x-mule-report` header added by the gRPC adapter.
