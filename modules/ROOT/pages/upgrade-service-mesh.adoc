Anypoint Service Mesh v1.2 introduces support for Red Hat OpenShift. Note that implementing these changes might require some downtime.


== Prerequisites

Before you upgrade, ensure that your environment uses:

* Anypoint Service Mesh v1.1.x
* The most recent version of the Anypoint Service Mesh command line interface (CLI)
+
The CLI version must be v1.2.x and the Anypoint Service Mesh version must be v1.1.x.
* Istio 1.7.x or 1.8.x or later for both control plane and data plane


== Steps

To upgrade to Anypoint Service Mesh v1.2:

. If you have not already done so, download the latest Anypoint Service Mesh command line interface (CLI) version:
+
`curl -Ls http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/servicemesh/xapi/v1/install > asmctl && chmod +x asmctl`
. Upgrade Anypoint service Mesh
+
`$ asmctl upgrade`
+
[NOTE] If you are using the EU control plane, you must specify the correct `--platformUri` flag for the upgrade.


// == Clean Up Post-Upgrade

// After the upgrade process is successfully completed, you can remove the backup copies of the previous version's files:

// . Delete the backups of adapters, APIs, and bindings:
// +
// `$ kubectl delete configmap -A -l 'service-mesh.mulesoft.com/backup'`
// . Delete the pre-upgrade jobs:
// +
// `$ kubectl delete job service-mesh-pre-upgrade -n service-mesh`
// +
// `$ kubectl delete job service-mesh-post-upgrade -n service-mesh`
