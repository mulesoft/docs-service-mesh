= Binding Your Service to an API Using a CRD

:keywords: service mesh, microservices, binding

When you create the binding, Anypoint Service Mesh creates a three-way association of the service in Kubernetes,the API that you created in Anypoint Platform to represent the service, and the adapter that you created for the service. 

The adapter uses the unique API ID to fetch policies and apply them to your services that are running in the cluster.

If you created the API in the previous procedure using Anypoint Platform, you use the API ID to bind the service. However, if you used the CRD to create the API, you must use the API name to bind the service.

After the binding is created, Anypoint Service Mesh takes a few seconds to complete the binding procedure and update the status. After the binding is completed, you can view the status using the `list` command. The status values include:

* Ready: The binding is now ready to be used. 
* Failed: The binding was not created successfully. An error occurred. 
* Binding: The binding is in the process of being associated with specific application.

In the following example, a binding called `customers` is created to bind the `anypoint-service-mesh-adapter` adapter with the `customers` service. This binding is created in the `nto-payments` namespace, which is the same namespace where the adapter was previously created, and is associated with the API that has the ID as 1234.

== Methods for Binding an API

You can bind an API to a service using Anypoint Platform or Anypoint Service Mesh, based on your preference:

* <<bind_the_service, Bind an API created using Anypoint Platform>>: If you created your API using Anypoint Platform, use this procedure.
* <<bind_using_ASM, Bind an API created using Anypoint Service Mesh>> : If you created your API using Anypoint Service Mesh, use this procedure.


[[bind_the_service]]
== Bind an API Created Using Anypoint Platform

Before you bind the service, ensure that you complete the task prerequisite.

*Task Prerequisite*
From the API Administration Tab of API Manager, obtain the API ID to create the binding using this method.

To bind the service with an API, perform the following steps:

. Go to *Anypoint Platform > API administration* and expand the API version name to display the instances.
. Click an instance name and copy the API ID that is displayed. 
Ensure that you save this API ID to a text editor.

+
. To retrieve the service name from Kubernetes, with which you want to bind the API, run the command:
+
`kubectl get svc -n <namespace>`
. Verify that your microservice port is named following the requirements requested by Istio: xref:https://istio.io/docs/setup/additional-setup/requirements/[].
. If you created your API using Anypoint Platform, use `spec.parameters.apiId`:

apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: <binding name> # example: orders-api-binding

    service-mesh.mulesoft.com/kind: adapter-binding

  parameters:
    apiId: <api ID> # example: 15722113
    service: <Kubernetes resource service name> # example: orders-service
----
+
The binding is activated within a few seconds and the API is successfully registered to the proxy.
. Verify the binding status using the following command:
+
`asmctl adapter binding list`
+
After you bind your API, the API in API Manager is marked as Active. You are now ready to apply policies to protect your APIs.

[[bind_using_ASM]]
== Bind an API Created Using Anypoint Service Mesh

To bind an API created using Anypoint Service Mesh Autocreate:

. Create your binding definition file and save it with a `.yaml` file extension, for example, 
+
`bind-api.yaml`:
. If you created your API using Anypoint Service Mesh, use `spec.instanceRef.name`:
+

apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  # name will be used as resulting secret name if no secretName is specified under the spec section
  name: <binding name> # example: orders-api-binding
  namespace: <namespace name> # example: default
  labels:
    service-mesh.mulesoft.com/kind: api-binding
spec:
  instanceRef:
    name: <api name> # example: orders-api
  parameters:
    adapter: <adapter name> # example: bookinfo-service-mesh-adapter
    service: <Kubernetes resource service name> # example: orders-service
----
+
. Apply the CRD using the following command:
+
`kubectl apply -f bind-api.yaml`
. Verify the binding status using the following command:
+
`asmctl api binding list`
+
After you bind your API, the API in API Manager is marked as Active. You are now ready to apply policies to protect your APIs.
