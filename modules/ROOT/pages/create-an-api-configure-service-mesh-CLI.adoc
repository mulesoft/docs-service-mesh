:keywords: service mesh, microservices, downloading, installing

After you provision the adapter, you must create an API to bind to the service. You can create an API using Anypoint Platform or Anypoint Service Mesh:

* <<create-api-AP, Create an API using Anypoint Platform>>
+
Create APIs using Anypoint Platform when your API specification files are larger than 550 KB. If you want to upload a REST API or an OAS asset type, use a `.json`, `.raml`, `.zip` or `.yaml` file. If you want to upload a SOAP API or WSDL asset type, use a `.wsdl` or `.xml` file.
* <<create-api-autocreate,Create an API using the Anypoint Service Mesh autocreate feature>>
+
You can configure Anypoint Service Mesh to automatically create an API in Anypoint Platform (no manual logging required). When creating APIs that require specification files, such as REST and SOAP APIs, ensure that the specification file is not larger than 550 KB and is available in your file system for the CLI to upload.

== Create an API Using Anypoint Platform

To create an API using Anypoint Platform, perform the following steps:

. Go to *Anypoint Platform > API Manager* and select the *Manage API* drop-down list. 
. Select *Create new API*.
+
The Creating an asset page is displayed.
. Specify a *Name* value and *Asset types* details for the API.  
+
Your asset is now created in Exchange for reuse. After you create the asset, you are ready to perform endpoint configuration.
+
The Endpoint Configuration window is displayed.
. In the *Managing type* field, select the *Basic Endpoint* radio button.
. In the *Application type* field, select the *Non-Mule application* radio button.
. Optionally, specify the *Implementation URI*, and click *Save*.
+
Your API is now created.

== Create an API Using the Anypoint Service Mesh Autocreate Feature

You can use any of the following options for authentication and authorization when creating an API using the Anypoint Service Mesh autocreate feature:

** Using <<create-api-ASM-CLI, user credentials>> (username and password)
+
This option supports only those users who:

*** Are managed by Anypoint Platform
*** Have not enabled multi-factor authentication
** Using <<create-api-ASM-CLI-ConnAps, Connected Apps credentials>> 
+
(Recommended) This option supports users:

*** Managed by Anypoint Platform or an external IdP
*** Whether or not they have enabled multi-factor authentication

=== Autocreate APIs by Using Your User Credentials

Before you configure the Anypoint Service Mesh autocreate feature, ensure that you obtain the:

* Environment ID and organization ID
+
To obtain these details, go to *API Manager > Environment Information*.
* Manage APIs Configuration permission for the environment where you are creating the API instance
* Exchange Contributor permission for the business group in which you are creating the asset

To autocreate APIs using user credentials, perform the following steps:

. Using Anypoint Service Mesh, type the following command to create the API:
+
