Before you download and install Anypoint Service Mesh, you must meet the  software, licensing, and permissions and roles requirements describes in this section.

== Software Requirements

Your Anypoint Service Mesh installation requires the following applications and Kubernetes environments:

* Kubernetes 1.12+ or a newer cluster, with RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) enabled
* Helm 2.13.0 or later
*Tip:* To verify installed version, use the `helm version`. 
For more information about how to install Helm, see the Helm installation documentation. .
* Kubectl version 1.12 or later (compatible with the cluster) is installed on your local machine
*Tip:* To verify installed version, use the `kubectl version`.
* One of the following environments on which to run Kubernetes:
** Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
** Amazon EKS
** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
* Not installed Istio in the cluster

If you want to enable automatic sidecar injection, you must additionally have:

* Install Kubernetes 1.12+ with admissionregistration API 
+
*Tip:* To verify the installation, use the command `kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1`.
* Configure kube-apiserver process with the admission-control flag to “MutatingAdmissionWebhook”.
+
* Add and list ValidatingAdmissionWebhook admission controllers in the correct order.


== Licensing Requirements

You require a Anypoint Service Mesh license to perform the installation. If you do not have a license, contact your MuleSoft representative.
Note that the license you procure must contain the following entitlements:

* API Gateway: api-gateway
* Cluster: clustering


== Permissions and Roles Requirements

Before you can use Anypoint Service Mesh, you must have the following roles and permissions:
 
* API Manager Environment Administrator permission or Organization Administrator role for your organization, to access the client ID and client secret credentials.
* Client ID and client secret credentials from Access Management.  
If you provision the adapter with organization credentials, you will be able to manage APIS on the specific adapter of that organization. 
+
If you specify environment credentials, you will only be able to manage APIs of that environment. MuleSoft recommends that you use the environment credentials instead of the organization credentials. For more information about which permissions to use, see xref:api-manager::org-credentials-config-mule4.adoc#obtaining-credentials[obtaining credentials].
* Cluster-admin role access to the Kubernetes cluster.
