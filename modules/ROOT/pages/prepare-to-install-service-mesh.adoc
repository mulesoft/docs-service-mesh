== Software Requirements

Your Anypoint Service Mesh installation requires the following applications and Kubernetes environments:

* Kubernetes 1.12+ or a newer cluster, with RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) enabled
* Helm 2.13.0 or later
*Tip:* To verify installed version, use the `helm version`. 
For more information about how to install Helm, see the Helm installation documentation. .
* Kubectl version 1.12 or later (compatible with the cluster) is installed on your local machine
*Tip:* To verify installed version, use the `kubectl version`.
* One of the following environments on which to run Kubernetes:
** Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
** Amazon EKS
** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
* Not installed Istio in the cluster

If you want to enable automatic sidecar injection, you must additionally have:

* Install Kubernetes 1.12+ with admissionregistration API 
+
*Tip:* To verify the installation, use the command `kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1`.
* Configure kube-apiserver process with the admission-control flag to “MutatingAdmissionWebhook”.
+
* Add and list ValidatingAdmissionWebhook admission controllers in the correct order.

== Hardware Requirements

Your Anypoint Service Mesh installation requires the following hardware configuration:

* CPU: 4 cores
* Memory: 8 GBs


== Licensing Requirements

You require a Anypoint Service Mesh license to perform the installation. Ensure that the license you specify is in a digested format. If you do not have a license, contact your MuleSoft representative.

Note that the license you procure must contain the following entitlements:

* API Gateway: api-gateway
* Cluster: clustering

*Need to add more infomation about the digested format.--Tomas*

== Permissions and Roles Requirements

Before you can use Anypoint Service Mesh, you must have the following roles and permissions:
 
* API Manager Environment Administrator permission or Organization Administrator role for your organization, to access the client ID and client secret credentials.
* Client ID and client secret credentials from Access Management.  
If you provision the adapter with organization credentials, you will be able to manage APIS on the specific adapter of that organization. 
+
If you specify environment credentials, you will only be able to manage APIs of that environment. MuleSoft recommends that you use the environment credentials instead of the organization credentials. For more information about which permissions to use, see xref:api-manager::org-credentials-config-mule4.adoc#obtaining-credentials[obtaining credentials].
* Cluster-admin role access to the Kubernetes cluster.


== Configuring Your Environment Variable 

Before you begin installing Anypoint Service Mesh, update your PATH environment variable to store system-wide values, such as the directories to search for the executable programs.

=== Configure Your Environment Variable on Windows

To configure your PATH variable on Windows:

. Perform the following step based on the Windows version installed in your environment:
.. For Windows 8 or 10, press the Windows key, and then search for and
select *System (Control Panel)*.
.. For Windows 7, right-click the *Computer* icon on the desktop
and select *Properties*.
. Select *Advanced system settings* > *Environment Variables*.
. Under *System Variables*, find and select the `PATH` variable, and then click
*Edit*.
. If there is no existing entry for the `PATH` variable, click *New*.
. Add your directory to the beginning of the variable value followed by `;` (a
semicolon). 
+
For example, if the value was `C:\Windows\System32`, change it to
`C:\Users\Me\bin;C:\Windows\System32`.
. Click *OK*.
. Restart your terminal.

=== Configure Your Environment Variable on Mac OS X

To configure your PATH variable on Mac OS X:

. Open the `.bash_profile` file in your home directory.
+
For example, type `CD /Users/<your-user-name>/.bash_profile`) in a text editor.
. Add the following command to the last line of your file:
+
`export PATH="your-dir:$PATH"`, where *your-dir* is the directory you want to add.
. Save the `.bash_profile` file.
. Restart your terminal.

. Open the `.bashrc` file in your home directory.
+
For example, type `CD /home/<your-user-name>/.bashrc`) in a text editor.
